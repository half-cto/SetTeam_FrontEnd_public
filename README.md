This project provided an exceptional opportunity for me to apply my skills to a real-world scenario, driving me to embrace new technologies, including AWS, and gain hands-on experience across the entire application development cycle.

Here's a summary of the challenges I encountered and the actions I took:

-   I began by sketching the initial flowchart of the application and defining DynamoDB access patterns. Transitioning from relational databases to DynamoDB was a learning curve, and I initially postponed UI design, which, in retrospect, I found to be a suboptimal approach.

-   To create AWS infrastructure as code using AWS CDK, I embarked on a significant learning journey. This was perhaps the most challenging aspect of the project, considering my lack of prior experience. I enrolled in an AWS & Typescript Masterclass on Udemy and delved deep into AWS documentation to master the necessary infrastructure creation.

-   Crafting REST API endpoints with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB was another task that required substantial effort. While I had some prior knowledge, I heavily relied on AWS documentation to complete this task successfully.

-   As I started building the frontend, one of the more demanding aspects was developing the ProjectTable component. Fortunately, I found comprehensive documentation for AntDesign, which proved invaluable in guiding me through this process.

-   Initially, I didn't plan for the application to adapt to smaller screens, but feedback from users prompted me to create a mobile-friendly version. Designing a functional UI for mobile presented challenges, but building it was expedited as I could leverage many functions and components that were already in place.
